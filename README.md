Following application would use IBM IoT platform service to receive your sensor data from Raspberry Pi 
and notify user via the Internet. Example of hooking up a PIR motion sensor on a Raspberry Pi with IBM 
IoT platform on Bluemix is avialable in the connectRaspberryPi2IoTPlatform.txt document.

This basic tutorial is composed of:
1) Web Application in Node.JS, Express.JS, and Angular.JS: subscribes to Raspberry Pi for motion sensor 
data, implements REST APIs and renders the sensor data in the view.
