Connect a Raspberry Pi to IBM Watson IoT Platform

1. Connect your Raspberry Pi to the internet
2. Connect Watson IoT platform to Raspberry Pi
- Download the installer on raspberry Pi: 
curl -LO https://github.com/ibm-messaging/iot-raspberrypi/releases/download/1.0.2.1/iot_1.0-2_armhf.deb
- Install the package on raspberry Pi: 
sudo dpkg -i iot_1.0-2_armhf.deb
- The iot process starts and publishes events to the IBM Watson IoT Platform.
sudo service iot status
sudo service iot stop
sudo service iot start
3. To visualize real-time device-data, get MAC address of your Raspberry Pi by running the following service command:
service iot getdeviceid
4. To register your Device In Watson IoT Platform, follow 
https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/iotplatform_task.html#iotplatform_task
5. Watson IoT Platform Registered connection
- Stop the IoT service on raspberry Pi
sudo service iot stop
- Create a configuration file to add IoT platform information and save
sudo nano /etc/iotsample-raspberrypi/device.cfg
#Device configuration file
org = yourOrganizationCode
type = iotsample-raspberrypi
id = <raspberryPi_macaddress>
auth-method = token
auth-token = yourAuthToken
#End of Configuration file
- Start the iot process
sudo service iot start
